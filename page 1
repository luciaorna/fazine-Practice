        Founded in 1994 by Dan Sinker, Punk Planet was a Chicago-based zine that redefined the boundaries of the underground. While many of its contemporaries focused strictly on the sonic aspects of the scene, this publication treated punk as a comprehensive DIY philosophy. It prioritized progressive politics, visual arts, and social activism, offering a sophisticated platform for voices often sidelined by the mainstream, including the Riot Grrrl movement and the LGBTQ+ community. The zine was celebrated for its clean, professional aesthetic which contrasted with the traditional "cut-and-paste" look of early punk media, proving that independent journalism could be both gritty and polished. Throughout its 80-issue run, it served as a vital cultural compass until its closure in 2007. Today, it remains a landmark of independent publishing, remembered for its commitment to the idea that being "punk" meant engaging critically with the world rather than just wearing the right leather jacket.

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Keep it,” Pajo replied.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not satisfied, the bearded fan opened a bag full of pills— “Well, can I give you some pills or something?”</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, man,” Pajo laughed, turning him down. “Really, I do the same thing.”</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Pajo tells the story at a cafe on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, I laugh. After all, it's a funny story. But it’s also a subtle reminder that the people that make the records are fans too. Pajo is no exception. Our breakfast meeting was supposed to be an interview, but we talked as much about other people’s music as we did about his. At the end of the interview, Pajo apologized sheepishly, “Sorry for rambling. I’m afraid it’s going to be all about the Mekons and Dylan.”</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few years ago the apology would have surprised me. After all, it’s a mighty long toss from Dylan’s <i>Self Portrait to Slint’s</i></p>

                    <p>Just to play music and be around friends. I mostly wanted to get out of Louisville. Of all the friends that I grew up with, there are only a few left there that are still playing music. I’d been there for so long, I just wanted to go somewhere. Every time I come here, the culture is just slammed into your face. There’s always so much going on. I needed some of that; I need a year of that.</p>

                    <p>Right now I’m working on stuff that I think is going to be solo stuff, but I don’t know if I’m going to call it Papa M or not. The new stuff sounds so good that I was thinking of doing it under another name, [laughs]</p>

                    <p>I think I’m getting back into that again. \ I got really into traditional music for a while there, which I’m still into. But trying to write traditional type songs, like verse-chorus type songs, doesn’t really come naturally to me.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Spiderland</i>. Pajo played guitar in the Louisville band that — according to whom you ask — changed everything or just changed a lot. A few years later he joined up with Tortoise in Chicago and made two records. He has been called to play with Stereolab, Royal Trux, and longtime Louisville compadre Will Oldham.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along — for a decade now — Pajo has been making his own music under variations of the moniker “M.” There was “M is the Thirteenth Letter,” “Aerial M,” and more recently “Papa M.” The vast majority of the “M” releases were of the liquid, ethereal variety familiar to Slint or Tortoise fans. Then he started singing, and everything changed.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his recent Papa M recordings, Pajo has invented a kind of otherworldly folk music. He takes freely from a rich tradition, but leaves something entirely his own.</p>

                    <p>When it started out, I wanted to do my own thing and I wanted to do it all myself— I wanted to play all the instruments; I wanted to record it. I didn’t know anything about recording or microphones, I was just going to teach myself. Then I got excited about singing and trying to write songs with words. And then I got more into electronica type stuff. It seems like it’s always changing. It’s almost like I get bored really easy or something.</p>

                    <p>I don’t know how it’s going to end up, but right now the songs are getting more dissonant again. When I was younger I was into anti-melodies: melodies that were unusual</p>

                    <p>Yeah, I recorded it myself on a Walkman. I think I played it for Will [Oldham] and he really liked it and thought it should be on the single I was doing, so I put it on there. I never even thought about singing and then I thought, "Well, this is a territory that I’ve never really messed with, maybe I should try it.” I have tons of tapes of me singing that I’d never release.</p>

                    <p>It was actually <i>Papa M Sings</i> , which was recorded right after a long tour where I was playing all instrumental stuff. Most of the bands that were opening for us were instrumental, too. So I came home and sang on all these cover songs and I liked it. I’m still trying to figure it out.</p>
